🚀 Excited to share my latest academic project!

 I recently completed an in-depth data science analysis titled "Distribution of Dugwells", focusing on groundwater issues across Indian districts using real government data 📊🌍
 
In this project, I:

 ✅ Cleaned and processed real-world water resource data using Python
 
 ✅ Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on issues like salinity, seawater intrusion, and industrial pollution
 
 ✅ Applied statistical methods like correlation, covariance, and outlier detection
 
 ✅ Created powerful visualizations to highlight critical regions and trends
 
 ✅ Interpreted patterns in dugwell usability, infrastructure availability, and environmental impact
 
The insights gained helped reveal the geographical distribution and condition of dugwells, enabling better understanding of water resource challenges. This project sharpened my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 📌

I'm excited about the role of data science in tackling real-world environmental issues, and I look forward to building more impactful projects! 💧📉
